### 2018 Challenge Statement

This year's challenge statement is "Build a product that uses public data to deliver insights for a business decision-maker."

### Find a problem that's worth solving

Go talk to folks who make decisions for their business: the head of a small business or middle management in a large business. Whoever that is, start asking them: How do you make decisions? What information do you use? What kind of research do you conduct? And, very important, what are the gaps that you would like filled? Find the data that can help fill in those gaps, and thatâ€™s your idea. Now, get to work on the product.

A lean canvas is a great way to lay out key components of your idea so you can start testing your assumptions and get to building something customers want *as fast as possible*.

To create a free digital version of a lean canvas, go to [Canvanizer](https://canvanizer.com/new/lean-canvas). Alternatively, you can print [this lean canvas](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/12663330/7f1ced9e-c5e4-11e5-9a5d-87582d98bfc3.png)

#### How to write a problem statement

Choose one of these two formats, and write down your problem:

- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` when doing `[type of task]`
- I believe `[type of people]` experience `[type of problem]` because of `[limit or constraint]`

You can have more than one problem statement, but no more than 3.

#### Identify existing alternatives
Take time to discuss as a group how people solve this problem today. Document all of the existing ways people solve the problem you want to solve.
