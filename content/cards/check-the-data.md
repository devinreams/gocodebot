You are required to use at least one data set from the Colorado Information Marketplace: http://gocode.colorado.gov/data/colorados-data-repository/

Our program is all about data, now is a good time to make sure the data you need is available to you. Itâ€™s a key ingredient.

Feel free to ask one of our data experts via the slack channel (#data) or in person during Challenge Weekend.
